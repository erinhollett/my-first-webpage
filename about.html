  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hi! My name is Erin. I'm currently studying Computer Programming at Humber College in Toronto. I'm working toward a career in Software Engineering. Before transitioning into tech, I spent three years as a Marketing Coordinator. I hold an Advanced Diploma in Business Administration - Marketing from Sheridan College. I discovered my passion for programming after some self-study and creating a personal project (check it out below!). </p>
